```groovy
class MyClass {
    def methodWithClosure(closure) {
        println "Before closure execution"
        closure()
        println "After closure execution"
    }
}

MyClass myClass = new MyClass()

// Correct way to pass a closure:
myClass.methodWithClosure { println "Inside closure" }

// This example demonstrates how to pass the closure as a reference, not calling the closure as a statement.  In this case, you would need a separate method to execute the closure.
//This is an example to show an alternative way to deal with the closure.
def executeClosure(closure){
    closure()
}

myClass.methodWithClosure({println "Inside Closure - Using executeClosure"})

executeClosure{ println "Inside closure - Using executeClosure"}

```
